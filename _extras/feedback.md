## Morning

### **UP**

Very useful.

Confluence page to refer to.

Interesting topic that will lubricate discussion with teams.

Was well organised and informative. Really good morning.

Lots of good applicable info I will definitely apply in future.

Interesting info on data handling and storage.

Great activities. Allow more time for discussion (rich learning).

Great use of google doc as an enabler

Good introductions

Good information supplied.

### **DOWN**

Nothing

Relevance to my pay scale.

A lot of discussing about things that are entirely out of some people's control. ie.g. as a RPO I have no say in how data is made public.

lost concentration getting data organised. 

None.

Pace a bit slow

Roadmap or schematic showing how each section / topic fits into whole day.

## Afternoon

### **UP**

Demo of DAP

Descussion re licences

Explanations are good, and useful

Good information, thanks

Plenty of project-specific and relevant information

Need to start talks in teams to use it

Discussion around DAP

Great capture of everything talked about. 

Excellent notes (maybe some slides would be good!)

Thank you. Was very informative and well structured.

### **DOWN**

Clarity around licences.

Just not so captivating as other sessions.

Information supplied too detailed - would have preferred to explore a bit and ask questions.

Explained future workflow for getting data in and clarifying ways forward.

Afternoon - sleepy after lunch

Shock of DAP, bigger than I thought

Too short wanted more detail.

Data sets required require more permissions that were indicated

Pare back content and allow more time for activities like doing DAP

Make DAP activity at start? Use it as a framework to explore FAIR

Not to be rude but ... the conversation around permissiveness and openess got a bit tedious.

## Morning

### **UP**

Very useful.

Confluence page to refer to.

Interesting topic that will lubricate discussion with teams.

Was well organised and informative. Really good morning.

Lots of good applicable info I will definitely apply in future.

Interesting info on data handling and storage.

Great activities. Allow more time for discussion (rich learning).

Great use of google doc as an enabler

Good introductions

### **DOWN**

Nothing

Relevance to my pay scale.

A lot of discussing about things that are entirely out of some people's control. ie.g. as a RPO I have no say in how data is made public.

lost concentration getting data organised. 

None.

Pace a bit slow

Roadmap or schematic showing how each section / topic fits into whole day.
